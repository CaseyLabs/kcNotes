# AI Agent Support

This repository includes optional guidance for AI coding tools. These files help
maintainers review, change, and validate the Go + HTMX CMS.

## Files And Directories

- `AGENTS.md`: durable repository rules for coding agents.
- `CLAUDE.md`: a small Claude Code shim that imports `AGENTS.md`.
- `.agents/code_review.md`: repository-specific `/review` checklist.
- `.agents/skills/`: task-specific workflows for compatible agents.

The root guidance stays short so it is useful in agent context. More detailed
review and task workflows live under `.agents/` where they can be loaded only
when relevant.

## Why This Is Included

The CMS has security, release, workflow, and packaging rules that are easy to
weaken accidentally. Agent guidance records those durable constraints close to
the code so automated changes are more likely to preserve them.

The guidance is also meant to keep changes small, reviewable, and grounded in
the actual `Makefile`, scripts, workflows, and configuration files.

## Adapting It

For this repository:

- keep `AGENTS.md` focused on durable project rules
- keep review-specific behavior in `.agents/code_review.md`
- keep task-specific workflows in `.agents/skills/`
- remove skills that do not apply to the CMS
- add subtree `AGENTS.md` files only where a directory has real local hazards or
  verification needs
- keep `CLAUDE.md` shims small when Claude Code compatibility is useful

Do not put secrets, credentials, private URLs, or unreviewed operational details
in agent guidance.

## Common Uses

- `/review`: inspect a change using `.agents/code_review.md`.
- `$security-review`: run the explicit security review skill when installed and
  supported by the agent.
- PR handoff drafting: summarize real diffs and validations after substantive
  changes are complete.

Agent support is optional for humans using the repository. The project should
remain understandable through `README.md`, `docs/`, and the root `Makefile`
without requiring an AI tool.
