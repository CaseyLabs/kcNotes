description: Use when validating that kcNotes still works as intended after changes to Docker-first Makefile workflows, scripts, CI, release packaging, smoke tests, or documentation alignment. Do not use for app redesign, GitHub-policy-only changes, or instruction-only skill edits with no workflow impact.

# Workflow validation

Use this skill when validating root workflow changes in this repository.

## Use this skill when
- changing `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `scripts/`, tests, packaging manifests, or workflows
- changing the default developer interface
- modifying CI or release behavior
- reviewing whether a root workflow change is complete
- checking whether implementation and documentation still match

## Do not use this skill when
- the task is primarily about app feature design under `src/`
- the task is only about GitHub-side settings guidance
- the task is only about release-integrity design without running validation
- the task is a small documentation-only edit with no workflow impact

## Goals
- Confirm that the repository still works end to end.
- Catch regressions in build, test, CI, release, packaging, and reproducibility behavior.
- Ensure documentation matches actual repository behavior.

## Method
- Prefer Docker-driven validation through the repository's public `Makefile` targets.
- Run the smallest relevant set of checks first, then expand if risk is higher.
- Verify that the documented public interface still matches the real workflow.
- Check that local and GitHub Actions paths still align where expected.
- Use `make scan` for security and workflow checks when security scanners, pinned actions, or workflow validation are affected.
- Use `make dist` for release artifact, SBOM, checksum, or integrity-output changes.
- When a real bug lacks regression coverage, add or update a targeted test.

## Minimum expectations
Validate the relevant subset of:
- `make build`
- `make test`
- `make scan`
- `make dist`
- documented CI helper scripts
- documented release helper scripts
- smoke or regression tests
- documentation affected by the change

## Output expectations
- List the checks run.
- List failures, risks, or skipped checks.
- State whether the change meets the repository's definition of done.
- Call out mismatches between docs and implementation.
